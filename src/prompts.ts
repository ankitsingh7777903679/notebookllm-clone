{retrieved_docs}

Your task:
1. Step back and consider the original question in a broad, general sense.
2. Review the retrieved information across all queries carefully.
3. Synthesize a single, coherent answer that directly addresses the user's original

4. If different queries highlight different aspects, integrate them into one clear
explanation.
5. Be concise, structured, and clear. When useful, cite or reference information
from the retrieved docs.
